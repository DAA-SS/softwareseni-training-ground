# SS PM GitHub Training Ground 🚀

Welcome to the **PM GitHub Training Ground**.  
This repo is designed for **non-developers** (PMs, product, etc.) to safely learn the new way of working in our **Hybrid AI Development Model**.  

The goal:  
✅ Write requirements in **Markdown**  
✅ Work directly inside **GitHub**  
✅ Use **Pull Requests (PRs)** for requirements & docs  
✅ Learn **context engineering** → not too verbose, not too short  
✅ Develop your first webpages.
✅ File bugs/issues **inside the repo**  
✅ Collaborate with developers & AI in one flow  

---

## Why This Matters
- **Speed:** Hybrid AI lets us deliver in weeks, not months.  
- **Clarity:** AI + devs need structured, machine-friendly inputs.  
- **Ownership:** PMs can now push requirements, docs, and fixes straight into the workflow.  
- **One Source of Truth:** Everything lives here → no more scattered Docs/Slides.

## What You’ll Learn
1. **Markdown basics** – headings, lists, tables, code blocks  
2. **GitHub essentials** – repo navigation, commits, branches  
3. **Pull Requests** – how to create, review, and merge  
4. **Context engineering** – balanced requirements that AI/devs can act on  
5. **AI prompting & review** – draft docs or release notes with AI, then refine  
6. **Bug logging in repo** – file structured Issues directly in GitHub

## Templates & Guides
- 📄 `docs/requirement-template.md` → Balanced requirement structure  
- 🐛 `docs/bug-report-template.md` → Structured bug logging format  
- 📋 `.github/pull_request_template.md` → PR checklist (goal, scope, stories, acceptance)  
- 💡 `docs/context-engineering-guide.md` → How to write good context  

---

## Fast Start
1. Go to **requirements/requirement.md**  
2. Edit it with your first requirement (use the template in `docs/requirement-template.md`)  
3. Commit to a new branch → `feature/your-name-demo`  
4. Open a **Pull Request** and fill in the checklist  
5. Request review → respond to comments → merge  

---

## Definition of Done (for this training)
- One merged PR that adds or updates a requirement  
- One Issue created using the bug template  
- Checklist in PR fully completed  

---

## House Rules
- Keep changes **small & frequent**  
- Always use **Markdown & PR flow**  
- Link references in `/requirements-references/*` (don’t paste walls of text)  
- Remember: **Speed + Risk Tolerance = Learning Faster**
